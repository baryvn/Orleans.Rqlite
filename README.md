[Orleans](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans) is a framework that provides a straight-forward approach to building distributed high-scale computing applications, without the need to learn and apply complex concurrency or other scaling patterns. 

[Rqlite](https://www.Rqlite.io/) Rqlite is a flash-optimized in-memory open source NoSQL database and the name of the eponymous company that produces it. The combination of in-memory and storage capabilities makes it ideal to use for scaled Orleans environments.
